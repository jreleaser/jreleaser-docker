Every command exposed by link:https://jreleaser.org/guide/latest/tools/jreleaser-cli.html[JReleaser CLI] can be invoked with this image.

You must mount the working directory at the `/workspace` volume, for example assuming the current directory is the
starting point:

[source]
----
$ docker run -it --rm -v `(pwd)`:/workspace \
  jreleaser/jreleaser-slim:<tag> <command> [<args>]
----

NOTE: The `jreleaser` command will be automatically executed inside `/workspace`.

You may also need to map environment variables to the container, such as `JRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION`,
`JRELEASER_GITHUB_TOKEN`, or others depending on your setup.
